    text: `Eduardo is one of the most talented frontend developers I've run into in my 14 years of IT-projects.
    He started in my team as a quiet and junior developer for JavaScript and React and in less than two years he become a mainstays of our front-end team. He was always motivated and ready to learn. I was particularly impressed by his ability to improve his skills by the feedback he got. He continuously improved his skills and grow with an incredible speed.
    In addition to his technical skills, he is a very good team player and was a valued member of the team.
    Thank you Eduardo for the great cooperation. Whenever you are around the door is always open.
    All the best.`

    text: `Eduardo stands out as one of the most talented and diligent software engineers with whom I have had the opportunity of working. I have managed Eduardo for half a year on a project on which he was working as a frontend engineer. Throughout this time, I was particularly impressed at the efficiency at which he could deliver high-quality code while fulfilling the business requirements and also implementing best-practices. His key achievement on the project was the delivery of a high-quality ReactJS frontend from scratch.

      His calm personality enables him to complete even the most difficult tasks to a high standard and with confidence. Eduardo did not shy away from sharing his views on how our product and workflows could be improved and this has enabled him to grow in his role and become a trusted advisor for our team. I am lucky to have had the opportunity to not only work with Eduardo but also learn from him. Eduardo would be an asset to any team, and I hope that I will get the chance to work with him on a future project.`

Eduardo impressed me from the beginning with his calm and reliable nature and consistently exceeded my expectations with the speed and quality of his delivery. Eduardo is not only a trusted pair of hands but is incredibly diligent and proactive, often making recommendations to improve the solution as well as delivering consistently and to a very high standard. I would absolutely recommend Eduardo to any large or small programme, he is an absolute pleasure to work with.`

    text: `Eduardo is always a quality driven software engineer and his learning speed was often surprising me. New topics where understood immediately and discussing complex problems where any time focused and result oriented. In over 2 Years of working together we never faced an unsolvable problem. Eduardo is a real Team player, with the right sense of humor to keep the Team motivated. In times where multiple problems clash together he step back, analyse them and solve them in the best possible order. So in summary technical and personal he was one of the main characters in our team for 2 years and I hope we will cross our paths again in the future.`
