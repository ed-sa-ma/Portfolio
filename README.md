## Technical description

The implementation is based in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), the applicstion framework powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). We use [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) as Content Management System, connected to an endpoint accessible by our application on load. By using [adapter-static](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static) we can prerender the whole application at build time. The result of that build are static HTML, CSS and JS files, which are then served by [Netlify](https://netlify.com):
